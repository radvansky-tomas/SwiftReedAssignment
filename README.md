# SwiftReedAssignment

Universal iOS application written in swift 2.1, supporting iOS8+ devices

### Screens
* Master
* Detail

### How it works

* Using splitVC to maintain master-detail view for iphones/ipads
* Loading JSON and parsing into swift Array of custom object
* Every object can load image data using NSURLSession
* And store UIImage inside for further use
* Every image load is performed on main thread
* Its storyboard + autolayout based -> fully responsive

### TODO

* use COCOAPODS
* replace json parsing with AFNetworking library
* replace image loading with SDWebImage to support caching


**Free Software, Hell Yeah!**
